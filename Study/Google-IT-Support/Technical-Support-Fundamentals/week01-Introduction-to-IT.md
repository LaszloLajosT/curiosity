# Introduction to IT

## 1) Introduction to IT Support
###### Notes from [Coursera Technical support fundamentals.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/technical-support-fundamentals/lecture/pjqmU/what-is-it)


### What is information technology?
> IT is essentially the use of digital technology, like computers and the internet, to store and process data into useful information.


-   There's growing skills gap is known as the digital divide.

### What an IT support specialist do?:
> An IT support specialist makes sure that an organization's technological equipment is running smoothly. This includes managing, installing, maintaining, troubleshooting and configuring office and computing equipment.

## 2) History of Computing
###### Notes from [Coursera Technical support fundamentals.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/technical-support-fundamentals/lecture/CbFIp/from-abacus-to-analytical-engine)


### What is computer?
> A computer is a device that stores and processes data by performing calculations.


-   Punch cards were the first binary system used for machines.
-   It took the powerful insights of a mathematician named *Ada Lovelace* to realize the true potential of the *analytical engine*. She was the first person to recognize that the machine could be used for more than pure calculations. *She developed the first algorithm for the engine*. It was the very first example of computer programming.

### What are the algorithm?
> An algorithm is just a series of steps that solves specific problems.


-   *Cryptography* is the art of writing and solving codes.
-   Alan Turing,
-   Enigma machine

-   The ENIAC was one of the earliest forms of general purpose computers.
-   *Open source* which meant that anyone could modify and share it.

## 3) Digital Logic
###### Notes from [Coursera Technical support fundamentals.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/technical-support-fundamentals/lecture/BLZaB/computer-language)


### Binary System:
> The communication that a computer uses is referred to as binary system, also known as base-2 numeral system. This means that it only "talks" in 1s and 0s.


- We group binary into 8 numbers, or bits.
A **bit** is a binary digit.
- A group of 8 bits is referred to as a **byte**.

### Character encoding:
> Character encoding is used to assign our binary values to characters so that we as humans can read them.


### Logic Gates:
> Logic gates allow our transistors to do more complex tasks, like decide where to send electrical signals depending on logical conditions.

## 4) Computer Architecture Layer
###### Notes from [Coursera Technical support fundamentals.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/technical-support-fundamentals/lecture/10AG6/abstraction)


### Abstraction:
> To take a relatively complex system and simplify it for our use.


- **Computer architecture:**
A computer can be cut into four main layers:
	- hardware,
	- operating system,
	- software,
	-  users.

### Hardware layer:
> Made up of the physical components of a computer.


### Operating system:
> Allows hardware to communicate with the system.


### Software layer:
> How we as humans interact with our computers.

### User:
> Interacts with the computer and she can do more than that.
